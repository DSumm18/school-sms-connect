## üìä Database Schema & Data Architecture

### Core Tables Overview

#### User Management
```sql

profiles {
  id: uuid (references auth.users)
  full_name: text
  -- RLS: Users can manage their own profiles
}

-- user_school_history: School assignment tracking
user_school_history {
  id: uuid
  user_id: uuid

user_emails {
  id: uuid
  user_id: uuid
  email: text
  is_primary: boolean
  is_verified: boolean
  -- RLS: Users manage their own emails
}
```

#### School & Organization Structure

trusts {
  id: uuid
  name: text
  dfe_group_id: text
  -- Trust-level information and grouping
  -- RLS: Public read for stats, admin access for management
}
```

#### Credit & Billing System
```sql
-- apps: Available services (SMS, etc.)
apps {
  id: uuid
  name: text
  description: text
  icon_name: text
  is_free: boolean
  status: text
  -- RLS: Public read for active apps
}

-- credit_balances: SMS credit tracking per school/app

  -- RLS: School members can view their usage
}
```

#### Messaging & Communication (Planned/Developing)
```sql
-- Various messaging-related tables for templates, contacts, scheduling
-- These support the core SMS functionality
```

### Row Level Security (RLS) Strategy

The application implements comprehensive RLS policies:

1. **User Data Isolation**: Users can only access their own profiles, emails, and school history
2. **School-based Access**: Data is scoped to user's current school assignment
3. **Role-based Permissions**: Admin users have elevated access where appropriate
4. **Public Information**: School directory information is publicly readable
5. **Audit Trails**: All significant actions are logged with proper access controls

## üîê Authentication System

### Authentication Flow
1. **Email/Password Registration**: Users sign up with school email addresses
2. **Automatic School Assignment**: Email domain determines school association
3. **Profile Creation**: Automatic profile creation via database triggers
4. **Session Management**: Persistent sessions with auto-refresh tokens
5. **Protected Routes**: All main functionality requires authentication

### Implementation Details
```typescript
// useAuth Hook Pattern
const AuthContext = createContext<AuthContextType>()

export const AuthProvider = ({ children }) => {
  const [user, setUser] = useState<User | null>(null)
  const [session, setSession] = useState<Session | null>(null)
  const [loading, setLoading] = useState(true)

  useEffect(() => {
    // Auth state listener setup
    const { data: { subscription } } = supabase.auth.onAuthStateChange(
      (event, session) => {
        setSession(session)
        setUser(session?.user ?? null)
        setLoading(false)
      }
    )

    // Check existing session
    supabase.auth.getSession().then(({ data: { session } }) => {
      setSession(session)
      setUser(session?.user ?? null)
      setLoading(false)
    })

    return () => subscription.unsubscribe()
  }, [])

  // Auth methods: signIn, signUp, signOut
}
```

### School Assignment Logic
- Users are automatically assigned to schools based on email domain
- One user can belong to one school at a time (enforced by `is_current` flag)
- School assignment is tracked in `user_school_history` for audit purposes
- Email domain parsing extracts school identifier for assignment

## üí≥ Payment & Credit System

### Credit Purchase Flow
1. **Package Selection**: User chooses SMS credit package (1,000 to 25,000 credits)
2. **Payment Method**: Card payment via Stripe or invoice generation
3. **Stripe Integration**: Secure payment processing with webhooks
4. **Credit Allocation**: Automatic credit addition via database functions
5. **Usage Tracking**: Real-time credit deduction and usage logging

### Stripe Integration Architecture
```typescript
// Edge Function: stripe-purchase
export const stripe_purchase = async (req) => {
  // Create payment intent or invoice based on request
  // Integration with Stripe API
  // Database record creation for tracking
}

// Webhook Handler: stripe-webhook
export const stripe_webhook = async (req) => {
  // Verify webhook signature
  // Process payment success/failure
  // Update credit balances via database functions
}
```

### Pricing Structure
- **Fixed Rate**: 1p per SMS (¬£0.01)
- **Bulk Packages**: 1,000 to 25,000 credits
- **No Expiry**: Credits don't expire
- **School-wide**: Credits shared across school users

## üé® Design System & UI Architecture

### Color System (HSL-based)
```css
:root {
  --primary: 24 85% 53%;        /* Orange brand color */
  --primary-foreground: 0 0% 100%;
  --secondary: 210 40% 98%;
  --accent: 210 40% 96%;
  /* Full semantic token system for theming */
}
```

### Component Architecture
- **shadcn/ui base**: Accessible, customizable components
- **Custom variants**: Extended button, card, and form variants
- **Responsive design**: Mobile-first with breakpoint considerations
- **Consistent spacing**: Tailwind utility classes with semantic tokens

### Page Structure
```
